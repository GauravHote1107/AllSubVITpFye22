Dear all,
We are happy to announced A mentorship program for all First Year Engineering students by DESH and SW&D. The main purpose of the program is to involve the seniors in guiding the juniors to ensure that timely guidance and assistance related to different courses, projects can be provided to all and individuals. The time table of such mentorship sessions will be integrated through the vierp system with regular academics. Meanwhile, all FY students are informed to attend all the mentorship sessions. The messages regarding the sessions time and venue will appear on the division group one day prior to the session. The attendance for all the sessions will be strictly monitored and mandatory for all students. 
One of the component of assessment for the courses Data Structures, Product Design and Development, Cognitive Aptitude, EDAI and DT will be attendance,  active participation and timely completion of all assignments of this mentorshipÂ program.
