Dear students,

We are excited to announce that we have built an in-house portal ‘Coding Classroom’ which streamlines the posting and grading of coding assignments.

Using this portal, we will conduct coding assignments for FY students.

From 2nd March onwards, assignments will be posted. Students are expected to solve and submit the assignments on the portal itself.

Attendance is mandatory for all students, and participation will be monitored by faculty members
