Dear Students,

VIT has taken up a nice initiative to make linkedin learning licenses freely available to some students in a view of help towards placements and making students industry ready. The selection criteria is centrally decided at institute level based on CPI of SemII AY23-24. If you are receiving this email then you are among the students who have been given access to a linkedin learning license. Please find attached a message from dean academics regarding this initiative.

Process to activate linkedin learning license:
1. Go to your usual linkedin account (on the site on https://www.linkedin.com/) and make vit.edu email ID as primary email ID for the account (this option is available in the account settings)
2. You must have received an invite from linkedin learning on your vit.edu email ID (if not please inform the academic coordinator of your department). Click on the link in the invite email.
3. On clicking, you will be redirected to the login page. Login to your linkedin account with vit.edu email ID.
4. Interface will ask you whether you want to connect your linkedin account with a linkedin learning account. Say Yes and proceed. Now you can freely access thousands of linkedin learning courses!

Use this opportunity to complete as many courses as you can. You can showcase it on your linkedin profile and it has a definite advantage in terms of placements as observed by several students across the world.
