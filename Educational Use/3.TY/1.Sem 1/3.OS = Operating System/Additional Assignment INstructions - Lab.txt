Print buffer full buffer empty as required
And as well about the ciritical regions


For bankers algorithn

N :number of processes
M: number of resources.

Take allocation matrix from user
Take max matrix from user 

Show total - allocation vector - to show available vector for each resource.
Which we comparw with need of available resources.


4 matrixes as final output.
And a safe sequence if safe sequence possible = true
