Dear Students,



Thank you for your interest in the NVIDIA DLI Fundamentals of Deep Learning workshop, organized on 23 rd August 2024 (Friday) from 11:30 am -19:30 pm (IST).

 

We will start at 11:30 am (IST) and finish by 19:30 (IST).

 

We will use the YouTube stream https://youtube.com/live/QiZqILqABM4?feature=share with a chat for the training and virtual machines provided by NVIDIA for the lab practices.

 

Please follow the instructions below to be prepared for the training day. This is a private event; sharing the invitation is not allowed.

 

1.      Create or log into your NVIDIA Developer Program account at

https://developer.nvidia.com/developer-program

 

2.      For enrollment, the key will be shared on the workshop. Students should go to https://learn.nvidia.com/dli-event and enter the access code.

 

3.      You should access to this course in your dashboard (https://learn.nvidia.com/my-learning) after the enrollment.

 

4.      Make sure WebSockets works for you.

Visit http://websocketstest.courses.nvidia.com and make sure all three test steps are marked in green. If there are any issues, try updating your browser or using a different one. The minimum requirement for bandwidth is 1Mbps per machine.

 

5.      Note that NVIDIA supports only the Chrome and Firefox browsers. Others could potentially also work, but are not supported officially, therefore technical issues may arise when using other alternatives.

 

As Webex is a third-party tool, I advise you to use the installed desktop version of the Webex application. Try to update or use another browser if you are receiving a “Bad Request” during the Webex connection.

 

6.      Website Access (ensure none of these are blocked by firewall or VPN)      

Ability to reach and log into NVIDIA websites:

https://www.nvidia.com      

https://courses.nvidia.com      

https://developer.nvidia.com        

https://developer.nvidia.com/dli/getready      

 

7.      Please test your system/audio. A headset might be useful to get the best audio quality possible and limit background noise and feedback. You will be responsible for resolving these issues.

 

8.      15 minutes before your event time, please visit and log into the session at
