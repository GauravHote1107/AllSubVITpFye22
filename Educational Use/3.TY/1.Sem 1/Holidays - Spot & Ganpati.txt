Batch 2 and Batch3-  we will have pretty much continuous holidays from 11 sep to 22 sep.

11 sep, wednesday :  mahalaxmi holiday ( official )
17, 18 sep : tuesday, wednesday : anant chaturthi holiday. ( official )

12, 13 :( thursday and friday ) we might get spot round related online lecs. But this will be only confirmed by college on 10th or 11th.

We might get 16 online as well, again due to spot rounds, but this isn't confirmed. ( Usually spot go on for 8 days, this year it's being shown as 10-13 sep only, usually also it's shown for 4 days, and later extended to 8 days )

 But anyhow batch 2 and 3 doesn't have much on thursday& friday ... so both 12 13 sep as well as 19, 20 sep...  related off , you might be able to take on the basis of attendance. 

With 21 and 22 being again sat,
 sundays.


Overall ,take holidays as per your own risk. Thanks !
