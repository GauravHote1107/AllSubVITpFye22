Dear students 

pls note

Section 1 is based on digital electronics. 
1. Refer Kharate for all types of example practice , e.g to express the in minterms, its canonical formation, solving by using kmap,all types of code conversion examples: e.g BCD-Gray/binary-gray, etc. Examples based on multiplexer, decoder e.g to solve SOP using multiplexer , decoder or to design some combinational circuit using multiplexer , decoder 
2. all types of flipflop circuits , their excitation table and  application design e.g counter(asyn and syn), sequence generator, etc

Section 2: Refer only the ppt or pdfs attached in this email.
8086 arch, mem segmentation, physical addr examples, addressing modes with examples, instruction type with examples, minimum mode and maximum mode theory and timing diagram for minimum mode : mem read/write and IO read/write
Interrupt types  , vector table and Architecture of 8259 priority interrupt controller



Thanks and Regards
