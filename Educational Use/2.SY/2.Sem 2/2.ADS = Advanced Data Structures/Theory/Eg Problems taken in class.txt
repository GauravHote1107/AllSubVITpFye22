 1. If tree is empty, create newnode as rootnode with
color Black
2. If tree is not empty, create newnode as leaf node
with color Red
3. If parent of newnode is Black then exit
4. If parent of newnode is Red , then check the color
of parent’s sibling of newnode:
(a ) If color is Black or null then do suitable rotation
and recolor (such that the root of the subtree is Black
and children are Red)(b) If color is Red then recolor (
parent and parent’s sibling) and also check if parent’s
parent of newnode is not rootnode then recolorand
recheck
rules: -> root color = Black -> no two adjacent Red
nodes -> count of Black nodes in each path is equal






Construct AVL Tree for the following sequence of numbers-

50 , 20 , 60 , 10 , 8 , 15 , 32 , 46 , 11 , 48






Create RBT 
Insert 2, 1, 4, 5, 9, 3, 6, 7







 Suppose the numbers 7 , 5 , 1 , 8 , 3 , 6 , 0 , 9 , 4 , 2 are inserted in that order into an initially empty binary search tree. The binary search tree uses the usual ordering on natural numbers.

What is the inorder traversal sequence of the resultant tree?







The preorder traversal sequence of a binary search tree is-

30 , 20 , 10 , 15 , 25 , 23 , 39 , 35 , 42





What one of the following is the postorder traversal sequence of the same tree?

10 , 20 , 15 , 23 , 25 , 35 , 42 , 39 , 30
15 , 10 , 25 , 23 , 20 , 42 , 35 , 39 , 30
15 , 20 , 10 , 23 , 25 , 42 , 35 , 39 , 30
15 , 10 , 23 , 25 , 20 , 35 , 42 , 39 , 30
