So as per today's CR/ACR meet....  there are few points which we are told to be shared with the class by our HOD - S.M. Lambor Mam.

1. EDI project must include hardware this common sem.

2. Our semester was possibly going to end around october end, but now after request, semester will be ending by 1st december and new semester will start by Tuesday 2nd of January 2024, after a christmas vaccation break. This means, final exams would happen before 1st of decembe. ( final approval for same is pending from dean academics though ) . But keep Upto 6th December in buffer and do not book tickets upto that day.

3. Best EDI projects will be selected for an exhibition in January .

4. I guess evergone's aware with this still typing...   :- We are under Department of Multidisciplinary Engineering (DOME), and not under core IT department, so we need to follow everything of DOME for this sem and not of IT dept.

5. Another good news, there's no mid-sem exam for us dome students.... however there's mid sem assessment, from next to next week or 17th July... presentations, group discussions or semiars are what they are.

6. EDI mid sem assesment of 30% weightage would be there, how ever , it's not there during current midsem assessment , it would happen later ig around august.

7. Some audit ( non-credit ) courses would be there.

8. Some link for a non compulsory course from some reputed comapany or something would be shared later. ( will confirm )...

9. and our usual... 75% attendance! For theory and tut, and 100% for lab ( ik, not gonna happen ), just complete all experiments and lab work....

Rest weightages are given in the dome syllabus, except the fact that edi has 4 credits instead of 6, the other 2 go to maths.
